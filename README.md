# KTH-Deep-Learning
This repository contains my work on DD2424 Deep Learning in Data Science at KTH Stockholm.

### assignment 1
This first work consists on training and testing a 1-layer network with multiple outputs to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The network is trained using mini-batch gradient descent applied to a cost function that computes the cross-entropy loss of the classifier applied to the labelled training data and an L2 regularisation term on the weight matrix.
