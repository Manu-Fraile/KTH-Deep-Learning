# KTH-Deep-Learning
This repository contains my work on DD2424 Deep Learning in Data Science at KTH Stockholm.

### assignment 1
This first work consists on training and testing a 1-layer network with multiple outputs to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The network is trained using mini-batch gradient descent applied to a cost function that computes the cross-entropy loss of the classifier applied to the labelled training data and an L2 regularisation term on the weight matrix.

### assignment 2
This second work consists on training and testing a 2-layer network with multiple outputs to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The network is trained using mini-batch gradient descent applied to a cost function that computes the cross-entropy loss of the classifier applied to the labelled training data and an L2 regularisation term on the weight matrix.

### assignment 3
The aim of this third assignment is to train a Convolutinal Neural Network (CNN or ConvNet) to predict the language of a surname from its spelling. In order to make this assignment "slightly harder", all accented letter were removed and replaced with its non-accented version thus considering only the letters in the English alphabet.
All the code was written from scratch based on the mathematical equations explained in the course and other reference papers. Deep Learning/Machine Learning libraries were never used.
